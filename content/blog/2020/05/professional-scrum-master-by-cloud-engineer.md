I decided to review and structurize my knowledge about Scrum framework - agile methodology to manage projects. I marked 6 points that helped me prepare and pass PSM 1.

<!--more-->

I really like that concept, because it comes with Continuous Improvement approach which is one of my personal values. There are more cons of course, each are well described on Scrum website, with good explanation of [what Scrum is](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).

> Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

I’ve been working as a cloud engineer in the agile environment for quite a long time. I have a lot of practical experience with all agile processes and terms such as **Sprint Planning**, **Sprint Retrospective**, **Sprint Review** and **Sprint** itself and i know it like the back of my hand. I am also a person, who is goal oriented. It is easier to me find a motivation to do something if i have target. So, I set up myself to pass **Professional Scrum Master** (PSM 1) exam in a week.

Here is my way:

1. I’ve read [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html) and created a mind map.
2. I did an [Open Assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments) for Scrum, Developer and Product Owner.
3. I went over [suggested reading](https://www.scrum.org/resources/suggested-reading-professional-scrum-master).
4. I’ve played with quiezes from [mlapshin.com](https://mlapshin.com)
5. I’ve constantly adjusted mind map with missing pieces
6. I took and pass the the exam!

## Mind Map

Until now I used to draw a mind map on the paper, but this time i wanted to try something new. I tried for the first time an online tool called [Coggle](https://coggle.it/recommend/5e9ad8411aab64689c0e89d5) and I really enjoyed. I was able to move and reorganize my map all the time. I think it looks good, but check on your own.
